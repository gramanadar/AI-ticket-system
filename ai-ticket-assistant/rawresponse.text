"summary": "Java project has conflicting dependency versions of external library C between two dependent projects A and B.",
"priority": "high",
"helpfulNotes": "The issue stems from conflicting versions of a dependency (project C) used by two different modules (projects A and B). This requires careful version management to avoid conflicts.  Solutions include:\n\n1. **Dependency Management:** Utilizing a build tool like Maven or Gradle to explicitly define dependencies and their versions. This avoids implicit transitive dependencies and allows for clear specification of the required version for each project.\n\n2. **Version Conflicts Resolution:**  Carefully assess the compatibility matrix of the dependencies and choose a version that satisfies both A and B, or explore alternatives to resolve the conflicts. Consider using dependency management tools to identify potential conflicts.\n\n3. **Dependency Updates (if possible):** Check if updated versions of A or B address the dependency conflict in project C. Newer versions frequently resolve such issues. Check for any version-specific incompatibilities in the external libraries.\n\n4. **Version Locking:** Tools like Maven and Gradle allow for version locking to fix project dependencies to specific versions. Using this strategy can ensure stability in project builds. Refer to the documentation of the tool you use to lock versions to your project.\n\n5. **Modular Architecture (Consider):** If possible, restructuring the project into independent modules for A and B might allow for different versions of C. However, this depends on the project's architecture. \n\nUseful Links:\n\n* Maven Dependency Management: [https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-management.html](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-management.html)\n* Gradle Dependency Management: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html)",
